'keeping my react up to date'

If you are reading this, it had been a few months since I have done any ReactJS work and wanted to do some practice using Reactjs.org 's basic tutorials before writing up a chess clone. Im just storing the tutorial along with the CSS and HTML files in case I put it up on a git page.
